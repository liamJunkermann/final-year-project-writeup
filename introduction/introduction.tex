\chapter{Introduction}
This chapter will introduce the general approach and motivation for this project, the expected outcomes, and a structure for the remainder of the report.

\section{Contents of the Introduction} 
The introduction presents the nature of the problem under consideration, the context of the problem to the wider field and the scope of the project. The objectives of the project should be clearly stated.
\section{Contents of the background chapter}	
The second chapter is typically a literature review, or survey of the state of the art, or a detailed assessment of the context and background for the project. The exact nature of this chapter depends on the topic and/or methods of the project. It is essential that the work of other people is properly cited. This will be discussed in detail in Chapter \ref{Chapt2} below. Note that you should use references wherever is appropriate through the report, not just in the literature review chapter.
\section{The Conclusions chapter} 
The final chapter should give a short summary of the key methods, results and findings in your project. You should also briefly identify what, if any, future work might be executed to resolve unanswered questions or to advance the study beyond the scope that you identified in Chapter 1.
