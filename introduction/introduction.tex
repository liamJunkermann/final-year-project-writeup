\chapter{Introduction}
This chapter will introduce the general approach and motivation for this project, the expected outcomes, and a structure for the remainder of the report.

\section{Motivations}
What motivated this project. Interest in rowing, rowing background, sports science is cool, blah blah blah
\section{Goals}
Target: ML to go fast. Data collection piece, data analysis piece, final model target.

\section{The Report}
How this reports structured, whats going to be covered.

Background - covering intro to sports science for rowing, and terms used for data analysis and modelling. Models which are used atm, why they work well, or don't.

Data Collection and management - Discussing how I collected data (made website and deployed bits, etc). How data was managed (s3 for raw data, dynamo \& rds for user generated/processed data).

Data Analysis + visualization - I mean, it does what it says on the box
Machine Learning Applications - what was the goal, considerations for the model, what'd we actually make

Discussion - Did we actually do the thing, how can we improve what we did, what stopped us from building the whole thing

Conclusion - uhm, some waffle to tie it all together

% \section{Contents of the Introduction} 
% The introduction presents the nature of the problem under consideration, the context of the problem to the wider field and the scope of the project. The objectives of the project should be clearly stated.
% \section{Contents of the background chapter}	
% The second chapter is typically a literature review, or survey of the state of the art, or a detailed assessment of the context and background for the project. The exact nature of this chapter depends on the topic and/or methods of the project. It is essential that the work of other people is properly cited. This will be discussed in detail in Chapter \ref{chap:background} below. Note that you should use references wherever is appropriate through the report, not just in the literature review chapter.
% \section{The Conclusions chapter} 
% The final chapter should give a short summary of the key methods, results and findings in your project. You should also briefly identify what, if any, future work might be executed to resolve unanswered questions or to advance the study beyond the scope that you identified in Chapter 1.
