\chapter*{Abstract}
A short summary of the problem investigated, the approach taken and the key findings. This should not be more that around 400 words.


This must be on a separate page.

\chapter*{Lay Abstract}
Similar to the actual abstract in terms of the information, but written for a non-specialist. So no jargon, no acronyms. Explain to a member of the general public what this project entailed. Should be no longer than the actual abstract.


This must be on a separate page.

If a parameter has a typical unit that is used throughout your report, then it should be included here on the right hand side.

If you have a very mathematical report, then you may wish to divide the nomenclature list into functions and variables, and then sub- and super-scripts.

If you have a large number of acronyms, check out \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Glossaries} to make that more robust.

Note that Roman mathematical symbols are typically in a serif font in italics.
